The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).

            The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. All versions around the world are printed by Grafica Veneta in Italy. A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main theme is death.Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness.

            Joanne Rowling , also known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author and philanthropist. She wrote Harry Potter, a seven-volume children's fantasy series published from 1997 to 2007. The series has sold over 500 million copies, been translated into at least 70 languages, and spawned a global media franchise including films and video games. The Casual Vacancy (2012) was her first novel for adults. She writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing crime fiction series, under the alias Robert Galbraith.
        </p>

            Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International in 1990 when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. There were six sequels, of which the last was released in 2007. By 2008, Forbes had named her the world's highest-paid author.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Rowling concluded the Harry Potter series with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007). The novels follow a boy called Harry Potter as he attends Hogwarts, a school for wizards, and battles Lord Voldemort. Death and the divide between good and evil are the central themes of the series. Its influences include Bildungsroman (the coming-of-age genre), school stories, fairy tales, and Christian allegory. The series revived fantasy as a genre in the children's market, spawned a host of imitators, and inspired an active fandom. Critical reception has been more mixed. Many reviewers see Rowling's writing as conventional; some regard her portrayal of gender and social division as regressive. There were also religious debates over Harry Potter.

        <p id="char"><h2 style="font-size: 40px;">CHARACTERS</h2><hr style="height: 10px;">
            <ol>
                <h2 style="font-size: 30px;"><li>SEVERUS SNAPE</li></h2>
        
                    Alan Rickman was the only person other than JK Rowling to know, from the start, where Severus Snape’s story was going. He had to, because Snape is a puzzle-box of a character, layering secrets and riddles over a heart that remains hidden until the very end. Let's face it: even the sneering, supercilious outermost layer is a delight to behold, Rickman's distinctive delivery squeezing malice out of every word. Then there's his shocking turn in Half-Blood Prince lashing out at Dumbledore, the one man who always had faith in him and his ultimate redemption in Deathly Hallows Part 2, revealing his tragic backstory and lifelong commitment to Harry, Dumbledore, and, most importantly, Lily Potter. It's this slow revelation of unguessed-at complexity that has put the school's most bullying teacher in the top spot on this list, in a testament both to Rowling's writing and Rickman's endless capacity for snark. We can only stand in wonder, and salute their efforts.<br><br>

                    <b>Trivia:</b> JK Rowling said that Dumbledore allowed Snape to bully pupils because Dumbledore believes that, "There are all sorts of lessons in life ... horrible teachers like Snape are one of them!"<br><br>

                    <b>Memorable Quote:</b> “How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He too was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.”

                    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;"><li>RON WEASLEY</li></h2>

                    The heart and funny bone of the central trio, Ron provides the lion's share of laughs over the course of the Potter books and we love him for it. But there's more to him than that. His relationship with Harry is not simply one of best friends, but a complex mix of love and envy. After all, while Harry envies Ron his large, loving family, Ron has to contend with his middle-child syndrome, and must contrast his own threadbare lifestyle with Harry's wealth. There's even a time when they seem to be rivals for Hermione's affection (at least in Ron's mind), and it's no wonder that there's tension there. But we love Ron because he always comes right in the end, abandoning resentment for affection and standing by both his blood family and surrogate family.<br><br>

                    <b>Trivia:</b> Ron's name never changed from the earliest drafts of JK Rowling's books.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Memorable Quote:</b> "Why spiders? Why couldn't it be 'Follow the butterflies'?"

                    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;"><li>HARRY POTTER</li></h2>

                    If Harry were a more self-centred person he'd probably object to placing third on his own list, but since the Boy Who Lived tends to err on the side of modesty, we're guessing he'd simply confine himself to horror that he placed above so many valued friends and teachers. That's perhaps the most likeable thing about Harry: despite the attention lavished on him by the entire wizarding world, he remains more conscious of his failings than his successes, and doesn't let it all go to his head. In Daniel Radcliffe's hands, the boy wizard grows up smart, reserved and quietly, fiercely loyal to his friends and ideals. Despite carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders and a sense of incipient doom in his heart, he stays determined throughout the series. For that steadfastness and courage, he'll always be our hero.<br><br>

                    <b>Trivia:</b> Harry shares JK Rowling's birthday, July 31.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Memorable Quote:</b> “EXPECTO PATRONUM!”

                    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;"><li>HERMIONE GRANGER</li></h2>

                    Hermione may start the Harry Potter films as an insufferable know-it-all, but she finishes them as an entirely sufferable, even loveable, know-it-all, someone who doesn't hide her smarts but also gives the people around her credit for intelligence as well. Her friendship with Harry and Ron rubs off Hermione's rougher edges, while age and suffering transform her into someone tactful. And, lest we forget, they wouldn't get far without her problem-solving and research abilities, not to mention her quick responses to danger (consider that hex she throws at Harry when they're chased by Snatchers in Deathly Hallows: Part 1). JK Rowling apparently gave her character an unusual name because she was afraid that children would get teased if they shared a moniker with Hogwarts' school swot. By this time, however, we're pretty sure that the name Hermione is a badge of honour rather than a cause of ridicule, because it turns out that the girl in the gang is maybe the most capable of the lot.<br><br>

                    <b>Trivia:</b> Hermione is based on JK Rowling herself at that age, and was screenwriter Steve Kloves' favourite character to write.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Memorable Quote:</b> "I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed or worse, expelled."

                    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;"><li>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</li></h2>

                    Like Gandalf with a sweet tooth, Albus Dumbledore is wise but also not above helping out short-arses. In his case that's 11 year-olds rather than hobbits, but the object defeating a great and looming evil remains the same. As wise as he is bearded, as eccentric as he is powerful and as fond of sherbet lemons as any man who ever lived, Dumbledore is a father figure and mentor to Harry but one who isn't slow about sending him into mortal peril when the occasion calls for it. He has made a few errors of judgment in his time his record on hiring Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers is, shall we say, patchy but he did foresee much of what transpired. And while he may not be able to choose a Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Bean without going wrong, we can hope that his faith in people will be borne out.<br><br>

                    <b>Trivia:</b> 'Dumbledore' is an 18th century word for a bumblebee.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Memorable Quote:</b> “You will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.”

            Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts and is sorted into Gryffindor House. He gains the friendship of Ron Weasley, a member of a large but poor wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch of non-magical, or Muggle, parentage. Harry encounters the school's potions master, Severus Snape, who displays a dislike for him; the rich pure-blood Draco Malfoy whom he develops an enmity with; and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort. The first book concludes with Harry's confrontation with Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to gain the power of the Philosopher's Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life.

            Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets describes Harry's second year at Hogwarts. Students are attacked and petrified by an unknown creature; wizards of Muggle parentage are the primary targets. The attacks appear related to the Chamber of Secrets, a fifty-year-old mystery at the school. Harry discovers an ability to speak the snake language Parseltongue, which he learns is rare and associated with the Dark Arts. When Hermione is attacked, Harry and Ron uncover the chamber's secrets and enter it. Harry discovers that the chamber was opened by Ron's younger sister, Ginny Weasley, who was possessed by an old diary in her belongings. The memory of Tom Marvolo Riddle, Voldemort's younger self, resided inside the diary and unleashed the basilisk, an ancient monster that kills those who make direct eye contact. Harry draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, slays the basilisk and destroys the diary.

            In the third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry learns that he is targeted by Sirius Black, an escaped convict who allegedly assisted in his parents' murder. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors – creatures guarding the school that feed on despair – he reaches out to Remus Lupin, a new professor who teaches him the Patronus charm. On a windy night, Ron is dragged by a black dog into the Shrieking Shack; Harry and Hermione follow. The dog is revealed to be Sirius Black. Lupin enters the shack and explains that Black was James Potter's best friend; he was framed by Peter Pettigrew, who hides as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. As the full moon rises, Lupin transforms into a werewolf and bounds away; the group chase after him but are surrounded by dementors. They are saved by a mysterious figure who casts a stag Patronus. This is later revealed to be a future version of Harry, who traveled back in time with Hermione using the Time Turner. The duo help Sirius escape on a Hippogriff.

            In Harry's fourth year of school (detailed in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), he is unwillingly entered in the Triwizard Tournament, a contest between schools of witchcraft and wizardry. Harry is Hogwarts' second participant after Cedric Diggory, an unusual occurrence that causes his friends to distance themselves from him. He competes against schools Beauxbatons and Durmstrang with the help of the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody. Harry claims the Triwizard Cup with Cedric, but in doing so is teleported to a graveyard where Voldemort's supporters convene. Moody reveals himself be to Barty Crouch, Jr, a Death Eater. Harry manages to escape, but Cedric is killed and Voldemort is resurrected using Harry's blood.

            In the fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned. Dumbledore re-activates the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society to counter Voldemort; meanwhile, the Ministry appoints Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts. Umbridge bans the Defense Against the Dark Arts; in response, Hermione and Ron form "Dumbledore's Army", a secret group where Harry teaches what Umbridge forbids. Harry is punished for disobeying Umbridge, and dreams of a dark corridor in the Ministry of Magic. Near the end of the book, Harry falsely dreams of Sirius being tortured; he races to the Ministry where he faces Death Eaters. The Order of the Phoenix saves the teenagers' lives, but Sirius is killed. A prophecy concerning Harry and Voldemort is then revealed: one must die at the hands of the other.

            In the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Snape teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts while Horace Slughorn becomes the Potions master. Harry finds an old textbook with annotations by the Half-Blood Prince, due to which he achieves success in Potions class. Harry also takes lessons with Dumbledore, viewing memories about the early life of Voldemort in a device called a Pensieve. Harry learns from a drunken Slughorn that he used to teach Tom Riddle, and that Voldemort divided his soul into pieces, creating a series of Horcruxes. Harry and Dumbledore travel to a distant lake to destroy a Horcrux; they succeed, but Dumbledore weakens. On their return, they find Draco Malfoy and Death Eaters attacking the school. The book ends with the killing of Dumbledore by Professor Snape, the titular Half-Blood Prince.

            In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh novel in the series, Lord Voldemort gains control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione learn about the Deathly Hallows, legendary items that lead to mastery over death. The group infiltrate the ministry, where they steal a locket Horcrux, and visit Godric's Hollow, where they are attacked by Nagini. A silver doe Patronus leads them to the Sword of Gryffindor, with which they destroy the locket. They steal a Horcrux from Gringotts and travel to Hogwarts, culminating in a battle with Death Eaters. Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia, but lends Harry his memories before he dies. Harry learns that Snape was always loyal to Dumbledore, and that he himself is a Horcrux. Harry surrenders to Voldemort and dies. The defenders of Hogwarts continue to fight on; Harry is resurrected, faces Voldemort and kills him.
